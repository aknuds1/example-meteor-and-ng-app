## Meteor/Blade/Angular Example App
Example Meteor application making use of Blade view templates and the Angular JavaScript framework. Instead of
JavaScript we use CoffeeScript, which gets automatically compiled to JavaScript by the server. Instead of CSS we use
Stylus.

This project is based off of Daniel Olano's [ng-meteor](https://github.com/olanod/ng-meteor) Meteor package. 

# Get started
In order to try the application, first run npm install and then grunt. This will launch a local server via mrt.
